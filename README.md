## Overview
Shroomfall is a multiplayer puzzle-platformer inspired by *Human: Fall Flat*, built around active ragdoll movement and intentionally goofy physics.  
You play as a customizable mushroom navigating handcrafted levels where movement, climbing, and object interaction all come from physically controlling your character’s body.  

Each level contains **three crystals** hidden throughout the environment.  
Collect all three to activate the portal and move to the next area.  
The game encourages teamwork—though how much cooperation you actually get from your friends is never guaranteed.

### Gameplay
Movement is fully physics-driven. You control each hand independently:  

- **Left Mouse Button** – left hand  
- **Right Mouse Button** – right hand  
- Arm height depends on where you’re looking  
- Grab onto ledges, objects, ropes, or other players  
- Climb, swing, carry, and solve platforming challenges using your physics body  

Early levels teach basic movement and climbing techniques before introducing more complex platforming, teamwork-based puzzles, and trickier crystal locations.
